# SheHacksHackathon2018

# Inspiration

We saw that there was a lack of an all-inclusive, friendly space where individuals can address their issues. There is also a lack of accessible resources and information in one place.

# What it does

Our services range from free online therapy to food banks to shelters and community meetings. 
We believe that no none deserves to feel alone, so we've partnered with the best organizers from all over the nation. 
We hope to give these communities a simple way to locate resources and learn about the biggest 
issues today to improve their current condition.

# How we built it

We wanted to assure the user had a calming experience without feeling intimidated so we made our contexts and our user experience as friendly as possible. We used stereotypical ‘calming colors’ and formatted any dialogue in a more friendly then professional manor.

# Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenges we faced throughout this project were the gathering of plenty of reliable and accurate resources. The most important aspect for us was to offer a variety of services as simply as we could.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

Working together effectively, dividing work accordingly & playing upon teammates' strengths and weaknesses.

# What we learned

Planning, Teamwork, Importance of User Experience, Resources

# What's next for LookListenLearn

The website will be tailored to each user's personal experience. In order to do this, we will incorporate A.I. through communications, retaining user information, and personalized resources. We also wish to offer meet-ups in the future, a map of resources in the user's location, and an NLP chatbot. 
For those who want to be more educated on these topics, we will offer interactive quizzes and ways that they can help the community out.
